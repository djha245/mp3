Q1) This code smell is duplicated code. The exact same code is used twice,
which allows us to use the extract method refactor tool to make our code
better.
Q2) This code smell is also duplicated code. This code is used four times,
allowing us to make an extract method refactor and make our code much better
with a new function and function calls.
Q3) This code smell is a feature envy. We can get rid of the class call by
simply moving the method into the jenkins class. This is where the method
should've been.
Q4) This was easily elimated by a simple loop that went through 4 times (the 
number of times the code originally repeated). Also, the outer loop was labelled 
so that the break broke to the correct part in the code.
